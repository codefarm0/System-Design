# System-Design
System design refers to the phase in the software development life cycle where the overall structure and architecture of a software system are planned and defined. This phase comes after the requirements analysis and involves translating the high-level requirements into a detailed design that can be used for implementation.
Key aspects of system design in software engineering include- 

1. **Architecture Design**
2. **Data Design**
3. **Interface Design**
4. **Component-level Design**
5. **Security Design**
   
The output of the system design phase is typically a detailed design document or set of documents that serve as a guide for the implementation team. This document **provides a roadmap for developers to follow** when building the software system, ensuring that **it meets the specified requirements and is scalable, maintainable, and robust**.
