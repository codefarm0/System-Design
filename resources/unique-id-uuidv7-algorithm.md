## UUIDv7 for Generating the timebased sortable unique Id

The UUIDv7 algorithm is designed to produce time-sortable UUIDs. It follows a specific format to embed the timestamp within the UUID while maintaining randomness and uniqueness. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm behind UUIDv7:

### UUIDv7 Format

UUIDv7 is a 128-bit identifier, divided into fields as follows:

```
0000tttt tttttttt tttttttt tttttttt tttttttt tttttttt rrrrrrrr rrrrrrrr rrrrrrrr rrrrrrrr rrrrrrrr rrrrrrrr rrrrrrrr rrrrrrrr
```

Where:
- `t` represents the timestamp bits.
- `r` represents random bits.

### Steps to Generate UUIDv7

1. **Obtain the current timestamp**:
    - Get the current timestamp in milliseconds since the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970).
    - This timestamp will be embedded into the most significant bits of the UUID.

2. **Generate random bits**:
    - Generate a random value to fill the remaining bits of the UUID.
    - This randomness ensures that even UUIDs generated at the same millisecond are unique.

3. **Set the version and variant bits**:
    - UUIDv7 has a version number (0111) which corresponds to 7 in hexadecimal.
    - The variant bits indicate the layout of the UUID. For UUIDv7, the variant is 2 (10 in binary).

4. **Combine timestamp and random bits**:
    - The most significant bits (first 64 bits) of the UUID are composed of the timestamp and version number.
    - The least significant bits (last 64 bits) are composed of the random value and variant.

### Detailed Steps

1. **Get the current timestamp**:
    ```java
    long timestamp = Instant.now().toEpochMilli();
    ```

2. **Generate random bits**:
    ```java
    long random = (long) (Math.random() * Long.MAX_VALUE);
    ```

3. **Shift the timestamp and combine with random bits**:
    - Shift the timestamp left by 12 bits.
    - Take the upper 12 bits of the random value.

    ```java
    long mostSigBits = (timestamp << 12) | (random >>> 52);
    ```

4. **Set the version number (0111)**:
    - Clear the 13th-16th bits.
    - Set the 13th-16th bits to 0111.

    ```java
    mostSigBits &= ~(0xF000L);
    mostSigBits |= 0x7000L;
    ```

5. **Set the variant (10)**:
    - Clear the most significant 2 bits of the least significant long.
    - Set the most significant 2 bits to 10.

    ```java
    long leastSigBits = random & 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFL;
    leastSigBits &= ~(0xC000000000000000L);
    leastSigBits |= 0x8000000000000000L;
    ```

6. **Combine the bits into a UUID object**:
    ```java
    return new UUID(mostSigBits, leastSigBits);
    ```

### Example

Let's generate a UUIDv7 step by step:

1. **Get the current timestamp**:
    - Assume the current timestamp is `1659986552000L`.

2. **Generate random bits**:
    - Assume the random value is `739671923278610L`.

3. **Shift the timestamp and combine with random bits**:
    - `1659986552000L << 12 = 6804422141952000L`.
    - `random >>> 52 = 0L`.
    - `mostSigBits = 6804422141952000L | 0L = 6804422141952000L`.

4. **Set the version number (0111)**:
    - `mostSigBits &= ~(0xF000L) = 6804422141944832L`.
    - `mostSigBits |= 0x7000L = 6804422141952000L`.

5. **Set the variant (10)**:
    - `leastSigBits = 739671923278610L & 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFL = 739671923278610L`.
    - `leastSigBits &= ~(0xC000000000000000L) = 739671923278610L`.
    - `leastSigBits |= 0x8000000000000000L = 9248576215051011346L`.

6. **Combine the bits into a UUID object**:
    - `UUID uuid = new UUID(6804422141952000L, 9248576215051011346L)`.

### Final UUIDv7

The final UUIDv7 generated by this example would be:

```
000180dd-0000-7000-8000-0a0c0a4b6e72
```

### Summary

The UUIDv7 algorithm ensures time-based sorting and uniqueness by embedding the current timestamp into the UUID, combined with random bits. The version and variant bits are set according to the UUIDv7 specifications. This format allows UUIDs to be sorted chronologically while maintaining high uniqueness.
